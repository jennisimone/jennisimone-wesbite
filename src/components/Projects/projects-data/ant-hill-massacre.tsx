    projectSummary: [
        <p>Ant hill massacre was the first video game I made. I made it to compete in a game jam where the theme was
            'Stronger Together'. In this game you play as an ant who needs to rescue other ants to save their ant hill
            which has been trapped by a rock.</p>,
        <p>This game was made using Unity and C#. It was primary a way to learn game development whilst contributing to
            an online community. </p>,
