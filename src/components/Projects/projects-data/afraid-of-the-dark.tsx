        <p>Afraid of the dark was a game I made for a game jam where the theme was "you are not alone". It's a simple point and click puzzle game where the user has to figure out how to protect themselves from ghosts at night.</p>,
        <p>This game was made using Unity and C#. It was primary a way to learn game development whilst contributing to
            an online community. </p>,
