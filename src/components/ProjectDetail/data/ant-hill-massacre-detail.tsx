        <p>Ant hill massacre is a platform game where you play as an ant trying to save it's colony. In the game, your ant hill has been destroyed by a boulder and the player ant needs to save it. Because ants are strong and have strength in numbers, you can remove the boulder but only with help, so you need to collect 10 other ants throughout the game. The game uses arrows and space to move jump and climb. This was the first game I made and published, and it was made for a game jam. The theme of the game jam was 'Stronger Together'.</p>,
        <p>The game was made using Unity and C#, the images were made in procreate on ipad and the music was made on garageband. As it was my first solo game, the game is fairly buggy (not just because of all the ants) and simple.</p>,
        <p>Due to the control requirements, the game is only playable on desktop.</p>,
